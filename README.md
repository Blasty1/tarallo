# T.A.R.A.L.L.O.
Tuttofare Assistente il Riuso di Aggeggi Logori e Localmente Opprimenti  
(aka L'inventario Opportuno)

An extremely granular inventory management software for computer hardware specifically, halfway between a CMDB (configuration management database) and a PIM (product information management).

## Installation

### Development

#### Beta method (use the tested method for the moment)

Install `docker` (usually `docker.io` in package managers) and `docker-compose` (same name).  
If you have macOS or Windows: go [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).  

- `git clone git@github.com:WEEE-Open/tarallo.git`
- `cd tarallo`
- `docker-compose up -d`
- go to http://localhost:8080 and eat some taralli üç© (this is the most similar emoji, don't judge me, okay?)

When you're finished: `docker-compose down`.  

If you have screwed up:  
- `docker-compose down`
- `docker volume rm tarallo_tarallo-web`
- `docker-compose build --no-cache`
- `docker-compose up -d`

We are working on loading some default data into the database at the moment (see [this issue](https://github.com/WEEE-Open/tarallo/issues/181)), only the interface works as of now.

#### Tested method

Use Vagrant. You know what to do. This method will be removed soon.

This is what you get, though:

* T.A.R.A.L.L.O. instance accessible at `127.0.0.1:8080`
* An example user (`dev.user`), that's generated on the fly for the development version and logs in automatically (you can't test the SSO component, sorry)
* APIs at `127.0.0.1:8080/v2/`
* A default token for APIs: `yoLeCHmEhNNseN0BlG0s3A:ksfPYziGg7ebj0goT0Zc7pbmQEIYvZpRTIkwuscAM_k` (see [documentation](https://github.com/WEEE-Open/tarallo/wiki/Managing-the-session-and-Authentication))
* Xdebug enabled by default
* Xdebug profiler enabled, start it via trigger (`?XDEBUG_PROFILE=1` or browser extensions), saves output to `xdebug` directory
* Adminer at `127.0.0.1:8081/adminer.php` for database inspection (user: root, password: root, server: localhost:3306)
* Database (MySQL/MariaDB) accessible externally by root at `127.0.0.1:3307` (note the non-standard port), connect PHPStorm to it!
* phpinfo at `127.0.0.1:8081/phpinfo.php`

#### Useful commands

If you need T.A.R.A.L.L.O. just for its APIs, not to develop it, here's a short list of some useful commands:

* `make down` shuts down the containers
* `make up` starts them again
* `make destroy` deletes the containers
* `make build` rebuilds the images
* `make dbupdate` updates the database schema (when instructed to)
* `make examples` resets database content with example items and products

If you're on Windows and you don't have make, open the Makefile and copy the raw commands, it's 1 or 2 commands for each one of these.

### Production

Make a git clone of this repo, then:

```bash
cp config/config-example.php config/config.php
nano config/config.php # Set the actual values
bin/build-cache
composer install --no-dev --no-suggest --classmap-authoritative --optimize-autoloader
```

And configure MariaDB and nginx, too. Look at `utils/provision`, there's an Ansible playbook just for that. It's really similar to our production playbook.

If this is the first deployment you'll need to import `database.sql`, `database-data.sql` and `database-procedures.sql` manually in the production database, if it is an update you may need to run the update script: use `php bin/update.php` on the server.

## More details

### Examples

There's a set of default items and products that can be used for tests.

You get that by running `make examples`. It will reset the database, deleting any items or products that you added.

There's not much more to it.

### Database

The schema is located in `database.sql`.

`database-data.sql` contains some "static" data needed for the software to work. It can be edited, but you'll need to run `make features` afterwards.

`database-procedures.sql` contains some procedures and triggers, all of these are needed for the entire thing to work.

### Feature list generation

`generate-features /path/to/this/directory` reads the feature list from `database-data.sql`, converts it to PHP data structures and places it into `src/Database/Feature.php` and some other files (`generate-features` tells you which ones when it's finished).

The prefererred way to run this script is to use `make features` instead of calling it directly. This is a CLI script, you shouldn't upload it to a server or access it from the browser.

Modified files should be manually reviewed and committed.

### Router cache

To enable FastRoute cache, set `CACHE_ENABLED` to true in `config.php`.

Caching probably won't work in developement, so you could enable it only in `config-production.php` (which `make` copies to `build/config/config.php`).

Cache files in `build` directory are generated automatically when running `make`.
